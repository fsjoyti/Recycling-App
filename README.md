# Can I Recycle This?

This web application helps a user to determine if a plastic product is recyclable in their community, based off of the zip code and the Resin Identification Code (RIC) they provide.

Most plastic products have an RIC, which is often on the bottom, surrounded by a chasing arrows symbol and molded, formed or imprinted in or on the container. These RICs range from 1 to 7 and are used to identify the material from which an item is made, to facilitate easier recycling or other reprocessing. These codes are not a guarantee that the item can be recycled, as not all recycling facilities can handle all RICs.

## Application Features
* Information about RIC codes
* The user can select the RIC of their plastic and the zip code they are hoping to recycle it in
* The application will return whether or not the item is recyclable in that zip code
* If the item is recyclable, the application will provide the address of the nearest recycling center
